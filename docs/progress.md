# Progress Log

## Session 5 — 2026-04-23 (afternoon) — Plan 2 MD reconciliation

**Model:** Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) via Claude Code CLI.
**Scope:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-16-plan-2-agents.md` edits ONLY — bring Plan 2 into alignment with Plan 1's Round 1/2 contracts, then add a query-focus-extraction enhancement. **Zero production code touched.** No plan task executed; this session was pre-execution document maintenance.
**Outcome:** One commit on `main` (`35f46e2`). Plan 2 file grew from ~350 → ~630 lines. Pytest unchanged at 34 passed + 2 skipped (this session did not touch test code). Plan 2 remains at "not started, fully unblocked" — its 15 task checkboxes are all still `- [ ]`.

> Session 4's entry below (#16 in the commit table, and the "User-authored commit" header at line ~44) treats commit `35f46e2` as if it originated outside Session 4. **It did — Session 5 is that session.** The two overlap on the same calendar date (2026-04-23) but are semantically distinct activities (Plan 1 hardening vs. Plan 2 MD maintenance).

### Commit landed

| # | Commit | Type | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `35f46e2` | docs(plan-2) | Bundles BOTH reconciliation waves (Wave A: Plan 1 contracts + env state; Wave B: focus extraction). 280 insertions, 69 deletions, one file (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-16-plan-2-agents.md`). |

### Work inside the session (two waves, single commit)

**Wave A — Plan 1 contract/env reconciliation (6 sub-changes):**
For each Plan-2-referenced interface, verified against the actual source file on disk (not against Plan 2's claims about it). Read `data_market.py`, `data_news/__init__.py`, `data_news/vector_store.py`, `data_news/store.py`, `config.py`, `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, `events/iran_war.yaml`. Applied the following fixes:

1. **`get_price_changes` `available`-flag contract** (from Session 4 commit `33f88f5`). Plan 2's Task 6 fixture `fake_changes` did not carry `"available": True`; the impl's gate was `if sym in changes:`. The current function returns every `cfg.tickers` symbol keyed — making `sym in changes` trivially true — and unavailable entries have `pct_change: None`. Under the old gate, `max(details, key=lambda d: abs(d["pct_change"]))` would raise `TypeError: bad operand type for abs(): 'NoneType'`. Rewrote the gate to `entry and entry.get("available")`. Same fixture update applied to Task 7 (end-to-end test) and Task 9 (market-node test).
2. **`.env` / `.env.example` pre-existing** (Session 2 commit `b15ba33`). Plan 2 Task 1 Steps 3–4 reworded "create" → "verify". Step 1 dropped `python-dotenv==1.0.1` from the requirements.txt append list (already pinned on line 2 since Session 2).
3. **langgraph pin bumped** `0.2.50 → 0.3.0` per user's explicit decision outside this conversation. `langchain` / `langchain-anthropic` / `langchain-core` pins left as originally scoped (`0.3.7` / `0.3.0` / `0.3.15`).
4. **Empty-`retrieve()` guards** added to `run_news_agent` (returns `{news_results: [], timeline: []}`) and `run_qa_agent` (returns `{news_results: [], response: {answer: "No indexed articles match this question.", citations: []}}`) for the case when the Chroma collection is missing/empty and `retrieve()` returns `[]`. `attach_news` and `attach_prices` were already safe (iteration over empty list is a no-op); only LLM-calling paths are affected, because the LLM would hallucinate against empty snippet input otherwise.
5. **`Co-Authored-By` trailer** added to all 15 task commit examples via HEREDOC form, per CLAUDE.md Acceptance Criterion #5.
6. **Top-of-plan "Changes from original (Session 3–4 reconciliation)" section** enumerates these six sub-changes with commit refs. Non-changes (interfaces verified still-matching) are listed too. The executing session can spot-check at a glance.

**Wave B — Query focus extraction (7 sub-changes):**
Design intent: `run_ripple_agent` was passing `state["query"]` as `generate_ripple_tree`'s `event_description`. A user typing *"Show me the ripple tree for Hormuz closure"* would inject the imperative prefix ("Show me the ripple tree for") into the LLM's input. Fix: extract the focus noun phrase ("Hormuz closure") upstream, pass only that. Kept cost minimal by folding focus extraction into the existing intent-classifier LLM call (no extra round-trip).

1. **`prompts/intent_system.txt`** now asks for JSON `{"intent": "...", "focus": "..."}` with focus rules: 2–6 word noun phrase; strip imperative verbs, trailing `?`, generic filler ("the ripple tree for", "the impact of"); return `""` on vague queries ("what happened?"); no invented topics.
2. **`AgentState.focus: str`** added to the TypedDict.
3. **`classify_intent` impl** parses JSON via new module-level `_strip_fences` + `_FENCE_RE` helpers (same regex as `agent_ripple.py` — duplicated for now, could be lifted later), validates `intent` against `_VALID_INTENTS` (defaulting to `qa`), defaults `focus` to `""`. `json.JSONDecodeError` degrades gracefully to `{"intent": "qa", "focus": ""}` — never raises. `max_tokens` bumped `10 → 100` for the JSON payload.
4. **`intent_examples.json`** fixture reshape from `[query, intent]` pairs to `[query, intent, focus]` triples (8 examples).
5. **Task 8 tests updated**:
   - `test_classify_intent_all_examples`: now asserts both `intent` AND `focus`.
   - `test_classify_intent_defaults_to_qa_on_garbage`: reframed — LLM returns VALID JSON with an INVALID `intent` value (`"gibberish"`); classifier still falls back to `qa`.
   - **NEW** `test_classify_intent_malformed_json_falls_back_to_qa_empty_focus`: LLM returns non-JSON text; assert `{"intent": "qa", "focus": ""}` with no raise.
6. **Task 10 tests rewritten**. The old `test_run_ripple_agent_delegates_to_m3` asserted `out["ripple_tree"]["event"].lower().startswith("show me")` — this **was locking in the exact bug we're now fixing** (see Deviations #3 below). Replaced with:
   - `test_run_ripple_agent_uses_focus`: state has `focus="Hormuz closure"`; assert `generate_ripple_tree` called with `event_description="Hormuz closure"`, not the raw query.
   - `test_run_ripple_agent_falls_back_to_display_name`: state has `focus=""`; assert `generate_ripple_tree` called with `cfg.display_name`.
7. **`run_ripple_agent` impl**: `event_description = state.get("focus") or state["cfg"].display_name`. `run_news_agent`, `run_market_agent`, `run_qa_agent` **unchanged** — they benefit from the full query text for retrieval; only `run_ripple_agent` uses the narrowed focus.

Expected-pytest counts in downstream Plan 2 tasks bumped accordingly: Task 8 `2 → 3`, Task 9 `3 → 4`, Task 10 `4 → 6` (+1 net from the replaced test + +1 for the new fallback test), Task 11 `5 → 7`, Task 12 `6 → 8`, Task 13 `8 → 10`.

### Tasks completed (plan mapping)

No Plan 2 task was executed this session. Plan 2's 15 task checkboxes are all still `- [ ]`. This was pure plan-document maintenance — a deliberately scope-limited pre-execution pass.

### Deviations from intended plan-session flow

1. **Plan mode activated mid-edit.** After the first Edit call landed (inserting the top-of-file "Changes from original" section), the Claude Code harness unexpectedly switched to plan mode — a restricted mode allowing writes only to a designated plan file under `~/.claude/plans/`. This was a harness action, not a user action. Workaround: wrote the full list of remaining edits as a structured plan to `/Users/fangyihe/.claude/plans/snuggly-hugging-willow.md`, called `ExitPlanMode`, then resumed regular Edit calls. All subsequent edits landed normally. **Not a project-level concern; a harness behavior** — if it recurs, the same workaround applies. Do not try to "push through" plan mode with more edits to the target file; the harness hard-blocks them.

2. **Two waves bundled in one commit.** Wave A and Wave B were introduced by the user as two sequential tasks in separate conversation turns. Both were pure plan-md edits against the same file, so they were committed together as `35f46e2` rather than split. Commit message body mentions both waves explicitly. This departs from CLAUDE.md's "one commit per task" norm, but that norm targets plan-task-sized units of production-code change; this was a single pre-execution doc-maintenance activity. Noted for honesty.

3. **The plan's own test was locking in the bug we needed to fix.** Task 10's original `test_run_ripple_agent_delegates_to_m3` contained `assert out["ripple_tree"]["event"].lower().startswith("show me")` — i.e. it expected the imperative prefix to survive into the event description. If the Wave B focus-extraction brief hadn't been written explicitly, a subagent executing Plan 2 would have satisfied this assertion by piping `state["query"]` straight through — exactly the bug we're fixing. **Lesson:** test assertions inherit any bias from the plan author's mental model; an assertion that "looks weird" (an imperative verb surviving into a field called `event_description`) is a red flag. Captured in CLAUDE.md's Subagent Review Checklist as entry 7 (Session 5 addition).

4. **Test-count maintenance is an easy-to-miss chore.** When updating a plan's tests (adding one, splitting one into two), the `Expected: N passed` lines in every DOWNSTREAM task's "run tests" step must also be bumped. Missed on the first pass in Wave B (caught during self-verification via `grep -nE "Expected: [0-9]+ passed"`). Future plan-maintenance sessions should `grep` for this pattern after editing tests.

### Files modified

- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-16-plan-2-agents.md` — 280 insertions, 69 deletions (one commit, `35f46e2`).

Additional end-of-session updates (not yet committed at time of writing):
- `docs/progress.md` — this section.
- `CLAUDE.md` — new Subagent Review Checklist entry #7.

### Current state (end of Session 5)

- **Pytest:** unchanged from Session 4 — `/opt/anaconda3/envs/macro-ripple/bin/pytest -v` → 34 passed, 2 skipped (~5s).
- **Git tree:** one commit ahead of `origin/main` after `35f46e2`; this wrap-up will add a second commit for progress.md + CLAUDE.md when the user asks.
- **Plan 2 file:** ~630 lines. 15 tasks all `- [ ]`. Verification checklist at bottom untouched (still references ~24 total unit tests — conservative estimate; actual post-Plan-2 count will be ~44 = 34 current + 10 new supervisor + agent-ripple tests).
- **Dependencies:** not yet installed. `requirements.txt` still does not contain `langchain*` / `langgraph*`. Plan 2 Task 1 Step 2 will `pip install` when executed.
- **Plan 2's new shape at a glance (for the next session):**
  - `classify_intent` returns `{intent: Intent, focus: str}`.
  - `run_ripple_agent` consumes `state["focus"]` (fallback `cfg.display_name`), delegates to unchanged `generate_ripple_tree`.
  - `run_news_agent` / `run_market_agent` / `run_qa_agent` unchanged; use `state["query"]` directly.
  - `AgentState` TypedDict has `focus: str` added.
  - Empty-`retrieve()` short-circuits in news + QA nodes.

### Blockers

**None.** Plan 2 Task 1 can start in the next session.

Pre-flight concerns to raise with the user BEFORE Plan 2 Task 1 Step 2 (`pip install`):
- `langchain-anthropic==0.3.0` and `langgraph==0.3.0` are new installs in a working env. Get user sign-off on the specific version pins before installing — per CLAUDE.md "executing actions with care," new deps that could break the existing test suite deserve confirmation even though Plan 1 code doesn't import them.
- `langgraph==0.3.0`'s `StateGraph` API has NOT been validated against the plan's code snippets. Plan 2 Task 1 Step 2 does a basic import check (`from langgraph.graph import StateGraph`); if Task 13's `graph.add_conditional_edges(..., path_map={...})` signature doesn't match the pinned version, that's a first-task surprise. If it breaks, option A is pinning `langgraph==0.2.50` (what Plan 2 originally specified) and updating the reconciled plan's "Changes from original" entry #4 accordingly. Option B is adapting the graph-assembly code in Task 13.

### Next session — exact next step

**Plan 2 Task 1**, as documented at end of Session 4 (§"Next session — exact next step" in Session 4's entry below). Pre-task checklist and commands are unchanged; just start. The focus-extraction wrinkle is entirely contained in Tasks 8 + 10 per the reconciled plan — no new cross-task dependencies.

## Session 4 — 2026-04-23

**Model:** Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) via Claude Code CLI.
**Scope:** Post-Plan-1 code review, then two rounds of hardening fixes. **Did not start Plan 2** — session ran long on surfaced issues. Plan 2 remains unblocked and is now better-prepared (Plan 2 file was reconciled to Plan 1's new contracts).
**Outcome:** **Plan 1 is DONE and HARDENED.** 34 pytest passing + 2 live-gated skipped (up from 21+2 at end of Session 3 — 13 new regression tests landed). End-to-end live run against real GDELT + NewsAPI + yfinance succeeds cleanly with zero noise. Retrieval quality improved: top hit for "Hormuz closure oil price" now scores 0.533 (was 0.39 in Session 3). 15 fix commits + 1 user-authored Plan-2 reconciliation = 16 commits added to main this session.

### Session structure

Session was organized into three phases, user-directed:

1. **Code review** — dispatched `superpowers:code-reviewer` subagent on Plan 1's full commit range (`1a4638a^` → `fc3704c`, the entire data layer). Came back with **4 Critical** (C1–C4), **5 Important** (I1–I5), **6 Minor** findings. Strengths-acknowledged: clean DATA_DIR isolation, library-quirk compliance, no hardcoded event data, above-average test quality.
2. **Round 1 hardening** — 8 commits, user-specified ordering (C3 first to "turn on the lights", then I3/I4/C1/C2+I1/I2/I5/C4). All 8 of the reviewer's Critical + Important findings addressed.
3. **Round 2 cleanup** — 6 more tasks in a fresh `superpowers:executing-plans` invocation: kill chromadb telemetry, deprecate RSS, NewsAPI pagination, lock down C3+I5 with tests, harden HTML stripping against prompt injection, and *actually* unify market missing-data semantics (Round 1's I2 was docstring-only; Round 2 Task 6 made it behavioral with breaking-change `available` flag). Round 2 surfaced a self-inflicted regression during verification (NewsAPI pagination dropped from 100→0 articles on live run); fixed in a follow-up commit before wrap-up.

### Commits landed this session (chronological — oldest first)

**Round 1 — hardening against code-review findings (8 commits):**

| # | Commit | Type | Finding | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ecd92fc` | fix(M1) | **C3** | `vector_store._collection(create=False)` now narrowly catches `InvalidCollectionException` (the legit "no data yet" case) and prints before returning None on anything else. Prevents Plan 2 LLMs from confusing a broken DB with "no hits". |
| 2 | `c454c8b` | test(M1) | **I3** | Two NewsAPI clamp assertions: `from_param` lands on `today-29d` when cfg.start predates it; client is never constructed when the whole window is stale. Monkeypatches `newsapi_fetcher.date` via subclass. |
| 3 | `45b6157` | fix(M1) | **I4** | `_strip_html` in rss.py (stdlib: regex + `html.unescape`). Fixture rewritten with `<p><a>…</a></p>&nbsp;`; test asserts no angle brackets + no entities in stored snippet. |
| 4 | `62dbc4c` | fix | **C1** | `setup.py --refresh` now also `rmtree`'s `data/prices/` and `unlink`'s `articles.json`. Test plants stale `STALE_TICKER.csv` + stale articles.json, runs --refresh, asserts both are wiped. |
| 5 | `36a4d3d` | fix | **C2+I1** | `deduplicate()` returns `(kept, stats)` where stats=`{input, url_dropped, minhash_dropped, kept}`. MinHash threshold bumped 0.9 → 0.95 (headline-only shingling collapsed distinct stories). `download_prices()` returns `List[str]` of missing symbols. Both surface in `manifest.json` as `dedup` and `missing_tickers` keys. |
| 6 | `eba54a7` | fix(M2) | **I2 (insufficient)** | Module-level `_WARNED_MISSING` set in `data_market`; `_load()` logs once per missing symbol. Docstrings enumerated the two "missing" cases per function. **This turned out to be docstring-only and insufficient** — Round 2 Task 6 replaced it with a real behavioral fix. |
| 7 | `15edf56` | fix(M1) | **I5** | Vector ID hash swapped from salted `hash(url)` to `hashlib.sha1(url)[:16]`. Stable across processes, unblocks future incremental reindex. |
| 8 | `e5a84ad` | fix | **C4** | `setup.py` takes an exclusive `fcntl.flock` on `$DATA_DIR/setup.lock` for the whole run. New `is_setup_in_progress()` helper for Plan 3's UI. Subprocess-based test verifies contention behavior. |

**Round 2 — cleanup + deferred work (7 commits incl. regression fix):**

| # | Commit | Type | Task | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | `a1138b2` | chore(vector_store) | R2-T1 (partial) | `Settings(anonymized_telemetry=False)` on `PersistentClient`. **Turned out not to work** (see Deviations); supplemented in commit 12. |
| 10 | `5fb2c8c` | docs(events) | R2-T2 | `iran_war.yaml: rss_feeds: []` with inline comment explaining Reuters RSS shutdown (June 2020). New top-level `README.md` documenting data-source strategy (GDELT primary, NewsAPI secondary 30-day, RSS deprecated). `data_news/rss.py` untouched — kept as skeleton. `tests/test_rss.py` now injects a synthetic `cfg.rss_feeds=["..."]`. |
| 11 | `db8beb9` | feat(newsapi) | R2-T3 | Paginate to `max_pages=5`; log `totalResults` on first page. **Introduced a regression** (see Deviations); fixed in commit 15. |
| 12 | `90f02db` | test(vector_store) | R2-T4 | Two regression tests: C3 error-surfacing (monkeypatch `_embedder` → RuntimeError, assert empty list + visible error text) and I5 stable IDs (`reset → index → collection.get()['ids']` twice, assert equal). Needed two supplementary in-file fixes: `reset()` now also calls `chromadb.api.client.SharedSystemClient.clear_system_cache()` (stale per-path SQLite handle cache), and `chromadb.telemetry.product.posthog` logger silenced at CRITICAL (real fix for R2-T1 — `Settings` doesn't suppress the buggy capture()). |
| 13 | `0726337` | fix(rss) | R2-T5 | `_strip_html` now strips `<script>...</script>`, `<style>...</style>`, `<!--...-->` CONTENT-AND-ALL (case-insensitive, DOTALL) BEFORE the tag strip, then unescapes. Prompt-injection hardening for Plan 2. Two tests cover script+style+comment+tag stew and case-insensitive newline-spanning `<SCRIPT>`. |
| 14 | `33f88f5` | refactor(data_market) | R2-T6 | **BREAKING:** `get_price_changes` now ALWAYS returns every `cfg.tickers` symbol as a key. Each entry has `{"available": bool, "baseline": Optional[float], "latest": Optional[float], "pct_change": Optional[float]}`. Plan 2 consumers iterate `cfg.tickers` + branch on `available` — no KeyErrors, no surprise partial dicts. Sibling functions documented for their distinct missing-data returns but behavior unchanged. |
| 15 | `862d263` | fix(newsapi) | R2-T3 regression | Free-tier hard-caps at 100 TOTAL results (not 100/page). Page 2+ always returns code `maximumResultsReached`. The whole-body try/except was swallowing the page-2 error AFTER page 1 already appended 100 articles, then returning `[]`. Now the try/except is PER-PAGE and `break`s on page-2 cap so page-1 results survive. 100 → 100 articles restored on live run. |

**User-authored commit:**

| # | Commit | Type | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | `35f46e2` | docs(plan-2) | User-initiated reconciliation of Plan 2 markdown with Plan 1's new contracts. Per commit message: updates `get_price_changes` fixtures/expectations for the `available` flag, marks `.env`/`python-dotenv` pre-existing (Plan 2 Task 1 should skip those steps), bumps langgraph pin to 0.3.0, adds empty-hits guards to news/qa agents, adds Co-Authored-By trailers. Also adds a "focus extraction" enhancement: `classify_intent` now returns `{intent, focus}` JSON so imperative query prefixes like "Show me the ripple tree for..." don't leak into the ripple-tree generator's `event_description` input. Plan 2 file grew from ~350 lines to ~630. |

### Tasks completed (plan mapping vs. scope creep)

This session had no Plan 1 or Plan 2 TASKS (Plan 1 was already done). All work was either:
- **Code-review-driven hardening** (Round 1 commits 1–8) — not in any plan file; triggered by post-Plan-1 review.
- **User-specified cleanup** (Round 2 commits 9–15) — user pasted a 6-task mini-plan as the `/superpowers:executing-plans` args; no plan file created/updated for it, which per CLAUDE.md's "Don't add features ... beyond what the task requires" is intentional.
- **User doc-edit** (commit 16) — Plan 2 markdown updated in a separate Claude session.

**No deviation from scope lock** — zero production code reached beyond Plan 1's `config.py`, `data_market.py`, `data_news/`, `setup.py`, `events/`, `tests/`. README.md added at repo root is documentation, not scope expansion.

### Deviations from plan/spec text (incidents this session)

Material moments where reality bit back. Future sessions that hit similar patterns should expect the same gotchas.

1. **R2-T1 "disable chromadb telemetry" didn't work with the first fix.**
   - Task text said "turn off anonymized_telemetry via Settings or env var, pick whichever is cleaner." Picked `Settings(anonymized_telemetry=False)` on `PersistentClient`. Claimed victory in commit `a1138b2` after a misleading stdout-only check.
   - **Reality:** `chromadb==0.5.18` fires `posthog.capture()` REGARDLESS of the `anonymized_telemetry` flag. The call fails with a signature mismatch (`capture() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given`) and chromadb's own `posthog` logger records it at ERROR level. Goes to stderr / pytest captured-logs, not stdout.
   - **Detection:** Caught in Round 2 Task 4 when pytest's "Captured log call" section showed 5+ telemetry ERROR lines per test. Verified with a naked `python -c ...` call against stderr → still noisy.
   - **Real fix (commit `90f02db`):** `logging.getLogger("chromadb.telemetry.product.posthog").setLevel(logging.CRITICAL)` at module load time. Cleanly silences the spam without suppressing our own logs. The `Settings(...)` line was left in place — it's the documented-correct way, doesn't hurt, may work on a future chromadb version that fixes the underlying posthog bug.
   - **Lesson:** verify stderr / logger capture, not just stdout, when claiming "no noise." Silencing via `logging.getLogger(...).setLevel(CRITICAL)` is the only reliable chromadb 0.5.18 workaround — now documented in CLAUDE.md "Library Quirks".

2. **R2-T3 "paginate NewsAPI to 5 pages" caused 100 → 0 regression on live run.**
   - NewsAPI developer tier is documented as "100 requests/day". Plan text assumed this meant 100-per-page limit and suggested 5 pages × 100 = 500 articles achievable.
   - **Reality:** the free-tier cap is **100 TOTAL results per query**, not per page. Requesting page 2 returns HTTP 426 `{"code": "maximumResultsReached", "message": "Developer accounts are limited to a max of 100 results. You are trying to request results 100 to 200. Please upgrade..."}`. Discovered during the verification live run.
   - **Secondary bug (worse):** the fetcher's `try/except Exception: ...; return []` was wrapping the whole page loop. Page 1 appended 100 articles to `results`, page 2 raised `NewsAPIException`, whole-body except caught it, fetcher returned `[]`. Result: **live run went from 100 articles (pre-pagination) to 0 articles (post-pagination).** Pure regression.
   - **Fix (commit `862d263`):** moved try/except INSIDE the page loop, narrowed to `NewsAPIException`, check `e.get_code() == "maximumResultsReached"`, then `break` (not `raise` or `return []`). Page-1 results survive. Log line rewritten to warn explicitly that "free-tier hard cap is 100 total, so page 2+ will 426" — prevents the next reader from chasing paging as a solvable problem.
   - Added a regression test (`test_fetch_newsapi_preserves_page1_when_free_tier_cap_hits_on_page2`) that simulates the exact failure mode with a `NewsAPIException` raised on page 2.
   - **Lesson:** "free tier X requests/day" vendor language is ambiguous between "API calls per day" and "total records returnable per query" — verify which by examining an actual error payload. Also: whole-body try/except around a stateful accumulator (results) is a latent bug; move boundary exceptions INSIDE the per-iteration loop.

3. **R1-I2 "unify missing-data semantics" was docstring-only — was not enough.**
   - Round 1 I2 (commit `eba54a7`) added docstrings explaining how `get_price_on_date`, `get_price_changes`, `get_price_range` each return different sentinels on missing data (`None`, omitted dict key, empty Series). Added a `_WARNED_MISSING` set + log line in `_load()` so missing CSVs become visible.
   - **Reality:** docstrings don't prevent `KeyError` at runtime. A Plan 2 agent doing `changes["BZ=F"]["pct_change"]` would still raise on any ingestion gap.
   - **Round 2 Task 6 (commit `33f88f5`) replaced it with a behavioral fix:** `get_price_changes` always returns EVERY `cfg.tickers` symbol as a key, and each entry has an `available: bool` flag. This is a **breaking change** (no backward-compat wrapper) but there are no Plan 2 consumers yet, and the user's reconciliation commit (`35f46e2`) updated Plan 2's fixtures and expected shapes to match.
   - **Lesson:** "document the contract" is not the same as "enforce the contract." If an invariant is important to downstream code, encode it in return-shape, not in English prose.

4. **chromadb's `SharedSystemClient` caches per-path SQLite handles across calls.**
   - The I5 stable-ID test did `reset() → index_articles(a) → get_ids()` then `reset() → index_articles(a) → get_ids()` in the same process. Second `index_articles` raised `sqlite3.OperationalError: attempt to write a readonly database`.
   - **Root cause:** `chromadb.PersistentClient(path=p)` looks up a singleton in `chromadb.api.client.SharedSystemClient`; our `reset()` was `shutil.rmtree`ing the directory but the cached client was still holding the old SQLite file handle, now pointing at a deleted inode.
   - **Fix (embedded in commit `90f02db`):** `reset()` now calls `chromadb.api.client.SharedSystemClient.clear_system_cache()` after `rmtree`. Documented in CLAUDE.md — any future caller who invokes `reset()` more than once in a single process would have hit this.
   - **Lesson:** chromadb's "persistent" isn't really path-isolated at the process layer — it's singleton-per-path, and `rmtree` on the path does not invalidate the cached client.

5. **R2-T3 `totalResults` value is inflated by NewsAPI.**
   - Live run printed `[newsapi] totalResults=464343`. That is not the real count of Iran-war-matching articles in the last 30 days; NewsAPI's `totalResults` field appears to be either a loose estimate or unfiltered-by-language upper bound. Actual fetchable count is capped at 100 (see deviation 2).
   - Log message was reworded in the regression-fix commit to make this explicit: "fetching up to 5 page(s) × 100 (note: free-tier hard cap is 100 total, so page 2+ will 426)". The `totalResults=464343` still appears in logs but the caveat follows it immediately.

6. **RSS yaml change broke existing RSS unit test.**
   - Setting `iran_war.yaml: rss_feeds: []` (R2-T2) meant `load_event("iran_war").rss_feeds` is now empty. `tests/test_rss.py::test_fetch_rss_filters_by_keywords` then iterates zero feeds and finds zero articles — fixture-driven assertions about rss-1/rss-3 all fail.
   - **Fix within the same commit:** test now does `cfg = load_event("iran_war"); cfg.rss_feeds = ["https://example.com/feed.xml"]` — mutating a pydantic model is fine (not `frozen=True`). Then `monkeypatch.setattr(rss, "_parse_feed", ...)` returns the fixture parse regardless of URL.
   - **Lesson:** pydantic v2 models in this project are **mutable by default**. Tests can inject synthetic values via `cfg.field = new_value` without any special-case pydantic magic. Now documented in CLAUDE.md.

### Current state (end of Session 4)

- **Pytest:** `/opt/anaconda3/envs/macro-ripple/bin/pytest -v` → **34 passed, 2 skipped** (5s). +13 tests net vs. Session 3.
- **New tests this session (13):**
  - `tests/test_newsapi.py`: `clamps_start_to_30_day_window`, `skips_when_window_entirely_before_free_tier` (R1-I3); `paginates_until_short_page`, `preserves_page1_when_free_tier_cap_hits_on_page2` (R2-T3).
  - `tests/test_rss.py`: `strip_html_removes_script_style_and_comments`, `strip_html_case_insensitive_and_spanning_newlines` (R2-T5).
  - `tests/test_setup_cli.py`: `setup_refresh_wipes_stale_prices_and_articles` (R1-C1); `setup_lock_blocks_concurrent_run` (R1-C4).
  - `tests/test_data_market.py`: `missing_csv_logs_once_per_symbol` (R1-I2); `download_prices_returns_missing_symbols` (R1-I1); `get_price_changes_keeps_missing_ticker_with_available_false` (R2-T6).
  - `tests/test_vector_store.py`: `retrieve_surfaces_unexpected_errors_instead_of_silent_empty` (R2-T4/C3); `index_ids_are_stable_across_runs` (R2-T4/I5).
- **Final live-run baseline** (`python setup.py --event iran_war --refresh`, last successful full run this session):
  - GDELT: 1,750 articles across 7 chunks (all 7 succeeded — clean run with no rate-limit hits; a previous same-session run had 4/7 chunk failures due to GDELT's "one request every 5 seconds" limit with our 2s sleep; chunks recovered gracefully per design).
  - NewsAPI: 100 articles, free-tier cap reached at page 2 as expected.
  - RSS: 0 articles (expected post-deprecation).
  - Dedup: 1,850 → 1,387 unique (`url_dropped=6, minhash_dropped=457`).
  - Prices: 11/11 CSVs, `missing_tickers=[]`.
  - Retrieval: `retrieve("Hormuz closure oil price", top_k=3)` → top hit **0.533** ("Crude oil could top $100 as Strait of Hormuz closure halts flows"); #2 = 0.479; #3 = 0.457. Session 3 baseline was 0.39 — improvement attributable to a larger (1,387 vs 1,217) and better-deduplicated corpus.
  - Market data spot-check on the new contract: `get_price_changes(cfg, date(2026,4,15))` returns all 11 symbols keyed with `available=True`, Brent +30.97%, WTI +36.21%, Aluminum +18.71%, CF Industries +21.37%, S&P 500 +2.09%, BOAT -2.08%, ITA -3.99%.
- **manifest.json** (actual contents on disk after final run):
  ```json
  {
    "event": "iran_war",
    "snapshot_utc": "2026-04-23T20:36:41.777234+00:00",
    "article_count": 1387,
    "source_counts": {"gdelt": 1750, "newsapi": 100, "rss": 0},
    "dedup": {"input": 1850, "url_dropped": 6, "minhash_dropped": 457, "kept": 1387},
    "ticker_count": 11,
    "missing_tickers": []
  }
  ```
- **Public APIs (updated shapes — Plan 2 must use these exact contracts):**
  - `config.load_event(name) -> EventConfig` (unchanged; pydantic mutable).
  - `data_market.download_prices(cfg) -> List[str]` (**new return type** — list of symbols that came back empty from yfinance; empty list means all-green).
  - `data_market.get_price_on_date(symbol, d) -> Optional[float]` (unchanged shape; docstring now calls out both missing cases).
  - `data_market.get_price_changes(cfg, as_of) -> Dict[str, Dict]` (**new shape** — always keyed by every `cfg.tickers` symbol; each value is `{"available": bool, "baseline": Optional[float], "latest": Optional[float], "pct_change": Optional[float]}`).
  - `data_market.get_price_range(symbol, start, end) -> pd.Series` (unchanged shape; docstring now calls out both missing cases; callers must `.empty` check).
  - `data_news.dedup.deduplicate(articles, minhash_threshold=0.95) -> Tuple[List[Dict], Dict[str,int]]` (**new** — returns `(kept, stats)` with `stats={input,url_dropped,minhash_dropped,kept}`; default threshold bumped from 0.9).
  - `data_news.retrieve / index_articles / reset / read_articles / write_articles` (unchanged surface — `reset()` now also clears chromadb's SharedSystemClient cache; transparent to callers).
  - `data_news.newsapi_fetcher.fetch(cfg, max_pages=1) -> List[Dict]` (unchanged signature; `setup.py` now passes `max_pages=5`; pagination respects the 100-total cap).
  - `setup.main(argv) -> int` (unchanged public shape; now fcntl-locked + observable).
  - `setup.is_setup_in_progress() -> bool` (**new helper** for Plan 3's UI to gate "refresh now" buttons).
  - `setup._setup_lock()` (**new internal** — `fcntl.flock` context manager; not public but exported via module for the concurrent-run test).

- **manifest.json schema (expanded):** `event, snapshot_utc, article_count, source_counts{gdelt,newsapi,rss}, dedup{input,url_dropped,minhash_dropped,kept}, ticker_count, missing_tickers`. The `dedup` and `missing_tickers` fields are new in Session 4.

- **Environment:** unchanged. `/opt/anaconda3/envs/macro-ripple/bin/python` (3.11). All `requirements.txt` pins untouched this session (yfinance still `0.2.66`, chromadb still `0.5.18`, newsapi-python still `0.2.7`). Plan 2 will add LangChain + LangGraph deps.

### Blockers

**None.** Plan 2 is fully unblocked. Specifically:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` present in `.env` (Session 2 state unchanged).
- Plan 2 markdown has been reconciled by the user (commit `35f46e2`) to accept the breaking contracts landed this session — Task 1's `.env.example` + `python-dotenv` steps can be skipped (already done), Task 6's fixtures use the new `{available, baseline, latest, pct_change}` shape, Task 8 (`classify_intent`) now returns `{intent, focus}` JSON instead of bare-word, Task 10 (`run_ripple_agent`) uses the extracted `focus` rather than raw `state["query"]` as the ripple generator's event description.
- No upstream-API health concerns visible in the final live run. GDELT's 5-seconds-between-requests rate limit is routinely bumped against on multi-chunk runs (see "Library Quirks"); the existing broad-except handler absorbs it gracefully.

### Next session — exact next step

**Plan 2 Task 1 (inline per CLAUDE.md Working Mode for deps/scaffolding).**

Source: [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-16-plan-2-agents.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-16-plan-2-agents.md) → Task 1.

Pre-task checklist before starting:

```bash
cd /Users/fangyihe/appliedfinance
/opt/anaconda3/envs/macro-ripple/bin/pytest -v                                      # expect: 34 passed, 2 skipped
git status --short                                                                   # expect: clean
/opt/anaconda3/envs/macro-ripple/bin/python -c "import config, os; print(bool(os.environ.get('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')))"  # expect: True
```

Task 1 per the reconciled plan:
- Append to `requirements.txt`: `langchain==0.3.7`, `langchain-core==0.3.15`, `langchain-anthropic==0.3.0`, `langgraph==0.3.0`. **Skip** `python-dotenv==1.0.1` (already pinned from Session 2).
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` and verify `from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic; from langgraph.graph import StateGraph` both import.
- **Skip** the `.env.example` + `.env` create/copy steps — both already exist from Session 2.
- Create `prompts/__init__.py` with the `load(name)` helper.
- Commit: `chore: add LangChain/LangGraph deps + prompt loader`.

Pre-Task-1 concerns to flag to the user before running `pip install`:
- Plan 2 reconciliation (commit `35f46e2`) bumped `langchain-anthropic==0.2.4 → 0.3.0` and `langgraph==0.2.50 → 0.3.0`. Nothing in Plan 1 imports either library, so the bump is safe, but it IS a version change in a working env — confirm before installing.

After Task 1, per the plan's mode mapping: Tasks 2 (`llm.py`) inline, Task 3 (prompts) inline, Tasks 4–7 (ripple tree: structure/news/prices/orchestrator) subagent each (LLM-heavy), Tasks 8–12 (supervisor nodes) subagent each, Tasks 13–15 (graph assembly, CLI, live smoke) inline.

## Session 3 — 2026-04-22 → 2026-04-23

**Model:** Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) via Claude Code CLI.
**Scope:** Plan 1 Tasks 6–12 (all remaining tasks) + two out-of-plan infrastructure fixes surfaced by the live smoke (yfinance upstream break, GDELT per-query cap, NewsAPI free-tier window).
**Outcome:** **Plan 1 is code-complete and end-to-end verified on live data.** 21 pytest passing + 2 live-gated skipped. `python setup.py --event iran_war --refresh` runs clean against real GDELT + NewsAPI + RSS + yfinance, writing 1,166+ deduplicated articles, 11 price CSVs, ChromaDB vector index, and a manifest. Semantic retrieval returns relevant Hormuz-closure headlines (top hit score ≈ 0.39). **Plan 2 is unblocked.**

### Commits landed this session (chronological)

| # | Commit | Type | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `1c0793e` | feat(M1) | **Task 6** — NewsAPI.org fetcher (secondary, opt-in via `NEWSAPI_KEY`). Subagent. |
| 2 | `717d6c2` | feat(M1) | **Task 7** — RSS fetcher with keyword filtering. Subagent. |
| 3 | `3e25d3f` | feat(M1) | **Task 8** — URL + MinHash dedup for cross-source news. Subagent. |
| 4 | `24adb51` | feat(M1) | **Task 9** — `articles.json` read/write layer. Subagent. |
| 5 | `44e2d12` | feat(M1) | **Task 10** — ChromaDB + MiniLM vector store with `retrieve()` public API; `data_news/__init__.py` populated for the first time. Subagent. Real MiniLM (local cache) used by test; no mock. |
| 6 | `0b69dbe` | feat | **Task 11** — `setup.py` CLI orchestrator with `manifest.json`. Inline (per CLAUDE.md mode map). |
| 7 | `deb4650` | test | **Task 12** — opt-in live smoke (`RUN_LIVE=1`) for yfinance + GDELT. Inline. |
| 8 | `3beabee` | fix(M2) | **Out-of-plan** — yfinance `0.2.51` broken upstream (Yahoo returns non-JSON → `YFTzMissingError` for every ticker). Bumped pin to `0.2.66` and added `multi_level_index=False` to `yf.download` (single-ticker default changed to MultiIndex columns in the 0.2.x line, silently corrupting CSV writes). Surfaced by the Task 12 live smoke. |
| 9 | `fc3704c` | fix(M1) | **Out-of-plan** — GDELT DOC API caps at 250 articles/query; split window into 7-day chunks with `num_records=250`, 2s sleep between chunks, per-chunk `try/except` so one failed chunk doesn't kill the run. NewsAPI free tier only serves the last 30 days; clamps `start_date = max(cfg.start_date, today-29)` and `end_date = min(cfg.end_date, today)`; whole body in `try/except` → `[]` on error. Updated `tests/test_gdelt.py` to match pagination (7 calls, not 1) and added a new chunk-failure resilience test. |

Session 3 commits on `main` (most recent first): `fc3704c` → `3beabee` → `deb4650` → `0b69dbe` → `44e2d12` → `24adb51` → `3e25d3f` → `717d6c2` → `1c0793e`.

### Deviations from plan text

Material plan deviations this session, with reasons:

1. **Task 6 — plan's `FakeClient.get_everything` positional signature kept kwargs-compatible.** Plan text declared `def get_everything(self, q, from_param, to, language, page_size, page)` as a positional-named signature. Subagent kept it verbatim; production code calls it with kwargs so Python binds by name either way. No code change; flagged here only because the user explicitly required "use all keyword and parameter consistently" when starting the session — satisfied because production uses kwargs and the fake accepts them as kwargs via positional-by-name binding.

2. **Task 10 — `_collection(create=False)` uses broad `except Exception`.** REPL-verified the pinned `chromadb==0.5.18` raises `chromadb.errors.InvalidCollectionException` when `get_collection` is called on a missing collection. Broad-except kept per CLAUDE.md "boundary try/except around third-party with real fallback strategy" allowance (future version may rename the exception). Not a deviation from plan text; flagged for future readers.

3. **Task 12 — `Filters(keyword=["oil"], ..., language="english")` → `Filters(keyword=["oil", "crude"], ...)`.** Two plan-text bugs caught by running `RUN_LIVE=1 pytest tests/test_smoke_live.py` once:
   - `gdeltdoc==1.6.0` `Filters.__init__` does not accept `language=` (same bug we hit in Task 5). Dropped.
   - 1-element `keyword=["oil"]` triggers GDELT's "The specified phrase is too short" error because the serialized query becomes `(oil)` with a single OR'd term — GDELT requires multi-word or multi-term queries. Changed to `["oil", "crude"]`. Documented in the `deb4650` commit body.

4. **Task 12 — `test_yfinance_live_fetches_spy` failed on first live run due to yfinance `0.2.51` being broken against the current Yahoo backend.** Every ticker (SPY, AAPL, MSFT, BZ=F) returned empty with `YFTzMissingError('possibly delisted; no timezone found')` because Yahoo returned non-JSON (likely an HTML block page). This is upstream infrastructure rot, not a plan-text bug. Fixed in commit `3beabee`:
   - Bumped `yfinance==0.2.51 → 0.2.66` in `requirements.txt`.
   - Discovered that single-ticker `yf.download` in the 0.2.x line (added at some point before 0.2.66) defaults to `multi_level_index=True`, returning `[('Close','SPY'), ('Open','SPY'), ...]` tuple-column names. Naive `df.to_csv()` then writes a garbage ticker-name subheader row *under* the real header, and downstream `pd.read_csv(..., parse_dates=["Date"])` reads that junk row as data and tries to parse `"SPY"` as a Date. Added `multi_level_index=False` to both `data_market.download_prices` and `tests/test_smoke_live.py`.
   - Mocked tests in `tests/test_data_market.py` broke because `fake_download(tickers, start, end, progress=False, auto_adjust=False)` didn't accept the new `multi_level_index` kwarg. Widened to `**kwargs` so the fixture is tolerant of future yfinance signature drift.

5. **Post-Task 12 — GDELT per-query cap + NewsAPI free-tier window.** User-directed work in commit `fc3704c`, not specified in plan text. GDELT DOC API caps `article_search` at 250 results per query; our fetcher previously returned only 250 articles for the entire 47-day window. Rewrote to iterate 7-day chunks (`while chunk_start < cfg.end_date`), each with `num_records=250`, sleeping 2s between chunks and wrapping each chunk in `try/except` so one ConnectionResetError doesn't blow up the whole pipeline. NewsAPI free tier rejects queries outside the last 30 days; added `max(cfg.start_date, today-29)` / `min(cfg.end_date, today)` clamping plus an outside-window short-circuit. The plan's Task 5 and Task 6 implementations were **not wrong** — they satisfied the plan text literally — but the plan text didn't anticipate these two operational ceilings. End result: GDELT now returns ~1,500 articles per event instead of 250.

6. **Task 5 legacy test assertions updated in `fc3704c`.** Existing `tests/test_gdelt.py` patched `GdeltDoc` *inside* `fetch()`; after pagination, the fake's `article_search` is called 7 times per fetch, not 1. Updated both existing tests to (a) track a list of filters, (b) only return the fixture on the first chunk (so assertion count stays `len(articles) == 2`), and (c) monkeypatch `gdelt.time.sleep` to zero so tests stay fast. Added `test_fetch_gdelt_chunk_failure_does_not_kill_pipeline` that injects a `RuntimeError` on chunk 2 and asserts the remaining 6 chunks still execute.

### Subagent review outcomes (this session)

Tasks 6–10 were all dispatched to subagents per CLAUDE.md's Working Mode table. Review of each against the Acceptance Criteria + Subagent Review Checklist found **zero corrective follow-ups needed** this session — a notable improvement over Session 2's Task 5 (which needed the `b4e9fbe` refactor to strip test-shaped decoration). Why the improvement:
- The brief template I converged on included: (a) full task text pasted verbatim, (b) explicit instructions to REPL-verify third-party library surface before implementing, (c) enumeration of red flags from CLAUDE.md's Subagent Review Checklist, (d) a "Report Format" requiring full pytest tail + `git diff HEAD~1 --stat`.
- Every subagent that hit a library-surface question ran `inspect.signature` or a tiny REPL probe before touching the code. Specifically:
  - Task 6 subagent verified `NewsApiClient.get_everything` signature (confirmed 6 kwargs match plan).
  - Task 7 subagent ran a feedparser REPL check confirming RSS 2.0 `<description>` → `summary` key + `published_parsed` as `time.struct_time`.
  - Task 10 subagent ran three REPL checks: `PersistentClient` signature, `embedding_functions.SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction` import path, `get_collection` raises `InvalidCollectionException` when missing.

### Current state

- **Pytest:** `/opt/anaconda3/envs/macro-ripple/bin/pytest -v` → **21 passed, 2 skipped** (5.21s). Skipped are the `RUN_LIVE=1`-gated smoke tests in `tests/test_smoke_live.py`. Running `RUN_LIVE=1 pytest tests/test_smoke_live.py -v` → 2 passed (both live probes green against current GDELT + Yahoo).
- **Public APIs available (cumulative — all surfaces working):**
  - `config.load_event(name) -> EventConfig`; `config.EventConfig`, `config.Ticker`.
  - `data_market.download_prices(cfg)` (writes CSVs, now with `multi_level_index=False`); `.get_price_on_date(symbol, d)`; `.get_price_changes(cfg, as_of)`; `.get_price_range(symbol, start, end)`.
  - `data_news.gdelt.fetch(cfg)` — now paginated 7-day chunks, ~1,500 articles on a 47-day window.
  - `data_news.newsapi_fetcher.fetch(cfg, max_pages=1)` — 30-day clamp + whole-body try/except.
  - `data_news.rss.fetch(cfg)` — keyword filter on `title + summary`.
  - `data_news.dedup.deduplicate(articles, minhash_threshold=0.9)`.
  - `data_news.store.write_articles(articles)` / `.read_articles()` — honors `DATA_DIR`.
  - `data_news.vector_store.reset()` / `.index_articles(articles)` / `.retrieve(query, top_k=5)` — real MiniLM + ChromaDB.
  - Package re-exports at `from data_news import retrieve, index_articles, reset, read_articles, write_articles`.
  - `setup.main(argv)` — CLI entry point; writes `articles.json`, `prices/*.csv`, `chroma_db/`, `manifest.json`.
- **Environment:** conda env `macro-ripple` at `/opt/anaconda3/envs/macro-ripple/bin/python`; `yfinance==0.2.66` (bumped from 0.2.51 this session), `python-dotenv==1.0.1`, everything else pinned per `requirements.txt`.
- **Data on disk (from one full live run):** `data/articles.json` (1,217 unique articles — GDELT 1,500 + NewsAPI 100 + RSS 0 → dedup), `data/prices/` (11 CSVs — ALI_F, BOAT, BZ_F, CF, CL_F, GSPC, ITA, NG_F, XLE, ZS_F, ZW_F), `data/chroma_db/` (ChromaDB persistent index), `data/manifest.json` (snapshot timestamp + source counts). All gitignored.
- **Spot-check findings from the live run:** Brent +30.97%, WTI +36.21%, Aluminum +18.71%, CF Industries +21.37%; S&P 500 +2.09%; BOAT (shipping) −2.08%, ITA (defense) −3.99%. Retrieval for "Hormuz closure" returns real-sounding headlines: "Brent Smashes Higher As The Strait Of Hormuz Is Closed | Live Wire" (score 0.39), "Brent To Stay Above $100 Through 2026 If Hormuz Closure Drags On Another Month" (0.33), "Brent Heads for Record Monthly Jump as Houthi Attacks Widen Conflict" (0.14).

### Plan 1 — Verification Checklist (from plan §end)

All boxes checked as of end of Session 3:

- [x] `pytest -v` → all non-live tests pass (21 passed, 2 gated-skipped)
- [x] `python setup.py --event iran_war --refresh` runs without errors (one transient ConnectionResetError on GDELT chunk 6 of 7 was gracefully skipped by the chunk-level `try/except`)
- [x] `data/articles.json` contains ≥ 500 unique articles (1,217)
- [x] `data/prices/` contains 11 CSVs, one per ticker
- [x] `data/manifest.json` contains snapshot timestamp + counts
- [x] `from data_news import retrieve; retrieve("oil Hormuz", top_k=5)` returns relevant hits (top 3 all real Brent/Hormuz headlines with positive similarity)
- [x] `from data_market import get_price_changes; from config import load_event; get_price_changes(load_event("iran_war"), date(2026,4,15))` returns a dict with 11 entries including `BZ=F`

**Plan 1 is DONE.** Plans 2 and 3 build on top of `retrieve()` and `get_price_changes()`, both of which are now green against live data.

### Blockers

**None.** All Session 2 blockers resolved in Session 2; Session 3 surfaced no new blockers. The one infrastructure issue found (yfinance 0.2.51 upstream break) was fixed in-session. ChromaDB emits noisy `Failed to send telemetry event ... capture() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given` warnings on every client operation — harmless, bug in `chromadb==0.5.18`'s telemetry code, not suppressed because CLAUDE.md says "do NOT suppress chromadb's own telemetry warnings" (stays out of scope). Documented here so future sessions don't chase it.

### Next session — exact next step

**Plan 2 Task 1.** Source of truth: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-16-plan-2-agents.md`. Read that plan file for the full task list. Per CLAUDE.md mode mapping: "Default to subagent for LLM-heavy code (agent_ripple, supervisor nodes), inline for UI tabs and eval modules." Plan 2 Task 1 almost certainly needs an agent (wires up `ChatAnthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-6")` with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` which is already in `.env`). Before Plan 2 Task 1, sanity-check:

```bash
/opt/anaconda3/envs/macro-ripple/bin/python -c "import config, os; print(bool(os.environ.get('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')))"
# Expected: True
```

If Plan 2 Task 1's acceptance test hits the real API, budget ~$0.01–0.05 per test run (Sonnet 4.6 pricing × a few hundred tokens).

---

## Session 2 — 2026-04-20 → 2026-04-22

**Model:** Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) via Claude Code CLI.
**Scope:** Plan 1 Task 4 (inline, TDD), Plan 1 Task 5 (subagent + review/refactor), Acceptance Criteria doc, `.env` infrastructure.
**Outcome:** Tasks 4 & 5 complete and committed on `main`. Project-wide Acceptance Criteria checklist codified. Secrets pipeline wired via `python-dotenv`. 10 tests passing. Both API keys now in place on disk; Plans 1 Task 6+ and Plan 2 are unblocked for credentials purposes.

### Commits landed this session (chronological)

| # | Commit | Type | Summary |

| 1 | `178f0d0` | feat(M2) | Plan 1 Task 4 — `get_price_changes(cfg, as_of)` + `get_price_range(symbol, start, end)` in `data_market.py`, 2 new tests in `tests/test_data_market.py` |
| 2 | `d6a9519` | feat(M1) | Plan 1 Task 5 — GDELT fetcher (`data_news/__init__.py`, `data_news/gdelt.py`, `tests/test_gdelt.py`, `tests/fixtures/gdelt_response.json`) via subagent |
| 3 | `b4e9fbe` | refactor(M1) | Post-subagent cleanup: removed decorative `filters.keyword=` / `.start_date=` / `.end_date=` assignments in `data_news/gdelt.py`; test now asserts on `Filters.query_params` (the library's real surface) |
| 4 | `60df2ee` | docs | Session 2 handoff first pass (this file) |
| 5 | `c3e8fc0` | docs | Added **Acceptance Criteria (every task)** six-item gate to `CLAUDE.md` — full pytest green, plan-only file scope, spec-matching signatures, no hardcoded event data, conventional commit + trailer, full pytest tail in report |
| 6 | `b15ba33` | chore | `.env` loader via `python-dotenv` + `.env.example` committed template; `config.py` now calls `load_dotenv()` at import time; added `python-dotenv==1.0.1` to `requirements.txt` |

### Tasks completed (plan mapping)

| Task | Commit(s) | Files touched |
|---|---|---|
| Plan 1 Task 4 — M2 % change + range (inline) | `178f0d0` | `data_market.py`, `tests/test_data_market.py` |
| Plan 1 Task 5 — GDELT fetcher (subagent + cleanup) | `d6a9519`, `b4e9fbe` | `data_news/__init__.py` (empty), `data_news/gdelt.py`, `tests/test_gdelt.py`, `tests/fixtures/gdelt_response.json` |

### Deviations from plan text

1. **Plan 1 Task 5 — `gdeltdoc.Filters` API shape.** The plan specified:
   - `Filters(keyword=..., start_date=..., end_date=..., language="english")`
   - Test assertions `f.keyword`, `f.start_date`, `f.end_date`

   Neither works against `gdeltdoc==1.6.0` (the pinned version):
   - `Filters.__init__` does not accept `language=` — raises `TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'language'`. Its signature only accepts `start_date`, `end_date`, `timespan`, `num_records`, `keyword`, `domain`, `domain_exact`, `near`, `repeat`, `country`, `theme`.
   - `Filters` discards the named kwargs immediately and stores the compiled query as `query_params: list[str]` (a list of URL fragments like `['(Iran OR Hormuz OR oil) ', '&startdatetime=20260228000000', '&enddatetime=20260416000000', '&maxrecords=250']`). The instance has no `.keyword`, `.start_date`, `.end_date` attributes after construction — `vars(f).keys()` returns `['query_params', '_valid_countries', '_valid_themes']`.

   **Fix applied:** dropped the `language=` kwarg from the `Filters(...)` call; rewrote the Task 5 test to assert on `query_params` content — `"Hormuz" in " ".join(f.query_params)`, `"startdatetime=20260228" in ...`, `"enddatetime=20260416" in ...`. English-only filtering, if needed later, is a separate change (either via `near`/custom query string or a post-filter on the returned DataFrame).

2. **Plan 1 Task 5 — subagent produced test-shaped production code.** The first subagent pass (commit `d6a9519`) discovered the `Filters` issue mid-implementation and chose to decorate the `Filters` instance with post-hoc attribute assignments purely to satisfy the plan's test assertions:

   ```python
   filters = Filters(keyword=..., start_date=..., end_date=...)
   filters.keyword = cfg.seed_keywords     # dead code — not read by article_search
   filters.start_date = start              # dead code
   filters.end_date = end                  # dead code
   ```

   Behavior was correct (yfinance-style: kwargs drive `query_params`), but those three lines existed solely to make the test's `f.keyword` / `f.start_date` / `f.end_date` introspection pass. That inverts TDD: production code was shaped by the test assertion mechanics rather than by the real library surface. Caught in review and refactored in commit `b4e9fbe` — removed the decorative lines and rewrote the test to assert on `query_params` directly.

   **Generalized lesson (now in `CLAUDE.md` under Acceptance Criteria):** a subagent returning green is *necessary but not sufficient*. Review the diff for (a) test-shaped decoration in production code, (b) files outside the plan's declared scope, (c) hardcoded event data, (d) silent downgrades like removed type hints or `except: pass`. Followup commit is the corrective action — do not amend.

3. **Not a deviation, but newly documented:** added the **Acceptance Criteria (every task)** section to `CLAUDE.md` (commit `c3e8fc0`) codifying the six-item gate every task must clear. This was an ad-hoc check I applied in this session; future sessions should treat it as mandatory.

4. **New infrastructure dependency — `python-dotenv==1.0.1`.** Not in the original plan. Added in commit `b15ba33` because the user chose `.env`-based secret management over shell `export`. `config.py` now calls `load_dotenv()` at import time, so any entry point that transitively imports config (every test, every future CLI / Streamlit run) gets `NEWSAPI_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `os.environ` automatically. Listed under a new "Config" heading in `requirements.txt`, pinned at 1.0.1.

### Current state

- **Pytest:** `/opt/anaconda3/envs/macro-ripple/bin/pytest -v` → **10 passed**.
  - `tests/test_config.py`: 3 passed
  - `tests/test_data_market.py`: 5 passed (Tasks 3 + 4)
  - `tests/test_gdelt.py`: 2 passed (Task 5)
- **Public APIs available:**
  - `config.load_event(name) -> EventConfig` — pydantic v2 model with `name`, `display_name`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `baseline_date`, `seed_keywords: List[str]`, `tickers: List[Ticker]`, `rss_feeds: List[str]`.
  - `config.Ticker` — pydantic v2 model with `category`, `name`, `symbol`.
  - `data_market.download_prices(cfg) -> None` — writes one OHLCV CSV per ticker under `$DATA_DIR/prices/`, filename via `_csv_path()` sanitization.
  - `data_market.get_price_on_date(symbol, d) -> Optional[float]` — close on a trading day; `None` for weekends / missing CSVs.
  - `data_market.get_price_changes(cfg, as_of) -> dict[symbol -> {baseline, latest, pct_change}]` — baseline is `cfg.baseline_date` close, latest is `as_of` close, pct_change is signed percent.
  - `data_market.get_price_range(symbol, start, end) -> pd.Series` — inclusive on both ends, Date-indexed Series of Close prices; trading days only.
  - `data_news.gdelt.fetch(cfg) -> List[Dict]` — each dict has `{url, headline, source, date, snippet, full_text, source_kind}`; `source_kind="gdelt"`; `snippet` and `full_text` always empty for GDELT (API doesn't return bodies).
- **Files on disk at end of session:**
  - New this session: `data_news/__init__.py`, `data_news/gdelt.py`, `tests/test_gdelt.py`, `tests/fixtures/gdelt_response.json`, `.env` (gitignored, user-edited with real keys), `.env.example` (committed template).
  - Modified this session: `config.py` (added `load_dotenv()` import + call), `requirements.txt` (added `python-dotenv==1.0.1`), `CLAUDE.md` (Acceptance Criteria section), `docs/progress.md`.
- **Environment:** conda env `macro-ripple` at `/opt/anaconda3/envs/macro-ripple/bin/python`; `python-dotenv==1.0.1` installed via pip (had been at 1.2.2 automatically pulled as a transitive dep; pinned down).
- **Secrets:** `NEWSAPI_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` both populated in `/Users/fangyihe/appliedfinance/.env` (gitignored, never committed). Verify with `/opt/anaconda3/envs/macro-ripple/bin/python -c "import config, os; print(bool(os.environ.get('NEWSAPI_KEY')), bool(os.environ.get('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')))"` → should print `True True`.

### Next session — exact next step

**Plan 1 Task 6 (subagent): NewsAPI fetcher.** Source of truth: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-16-plan-1-data-foundation.md` → Task 6. Unit tests mock `NewsApiClient` so no live API calls happen during pytest — but `NEWSAPI_KEY` is now in `.env` for any live smoke run the session wants to do afterward.

**Subagent brief must include** (do not let it read the plan file — paste the task text inline):
- Which commits have already landed on `main` (`b15ba33` head; Task 5 + its cleanup are in). Pytest baseline is 10 passed.
- Public APIs it can import (`config.load_event`, etc. — see "Public APIs available" above).
- `python-dotenv` auto-loads `.env`; tests should monkeypatch `NEWSAPI_KEY` via `monkeypatch.setenv` / `monkeypatch.delenv` anyway, so they don't depend on the real key.
- Reminder of the six Acceptance Criteria in `CLAUDE.md`.
- The `gdeltdoc.Filters` lesson generalizes: when a plan's test assertions reference attributes of a third-party object, verify those attributes actually exist in the pinned library version before accepting the plan text verbatim. For `newsapi-python==0.2.7`, `NewsApiClient.get_everything(...)` returns a plain dict — safe, no special attrs.

After Task 6, remaining Plan 1 tasks per the mode mapping in `CLAUDE.md`:
- Task 7 — RSS fetcher (subagent)
- Task 8 — URL + MinHash dedup (subagent)
- Task 9 — articles.json store (subagent)
- Task 10 — ChromaDB vector store + `retrieve()` (subagent; first run downloads ~80 MB MiniLM model)
- Task 11 — `setup.py` orchestrator (inline; remember to add `from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()` at the top — or just `import config` which does the same thing — before any fetcher that reads env keys)
- Task 12 — live smoke test (inline, gated by `RUN_LIVE=1`)

### Blockers

**All Session 1 blockers resolved.** Status as of end of Session 2:

1. ~~`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` missing~~ — **resolved.** Populated in `.env`; will be picked up by `langchain-anthropic` via `os.environ` in Plan 2. Budget is user's pay-as-you-go account.
2. ~~`NEWSAPI_KEY` missing~~ — **resolved.** Populated in `.env`. Free tier (100 req/day); if Plan 1 Task 6 live smoke hits the limit, either wait 24h or remove NewsAPI from the active source set (its `fetch()` returns `[]` when the key is unset, so degradation is graceful).
3. **Plan 2 ready to start** whenever Plan 1 lands. No new blockers anticipated.
4. **New operational concern (not a blocker but worth flagging):** ChromaDB persistent store lives at `$DATA_DIR/chroma_db/`. Task 10 will build it; Task 11 (`setup.py`) will populate it. Size estimate: ~10–50 MB depending on article count. Already gitignored via `data/` rule. No action needed.

**Repo scaffolding (Task 1):**
- `environment.yml` — conda env `macro-ripple`, Python 3.11, references `requirements.txt` via pip.
- `requirements.txt` — pinned deps (yfinance 0.2.51, pandas 2.2.3, pydantic 2.9.2, gdeltdoc 1.6.0, newsapi-python 0.2.7, feedparser 6.0.11, datasketch 1.6.5, chromadb 0.5.18, sentence-transformers 3.2.1, langchain-anthropic 0.2.4, langgraph 0.2.50, streamlit 1.40.2, plotly 5.24.1, streamlit-agraph 0.0.45, pytest 8.3.3, pytest-mock 3.14.0, responses 0.25.3).

- `tests/conftest.py` — `fixtures_dir` and `tmp_data_dir` (sets `DATA_DIR` env var for test isolation).
- `tests/fixtures/.gitkeep` — placeholder.
- `data/.gitkeep` — placeholder.

**Task 2:**
- `config.py` — `Ticker` (category/name/symbol), `EventConfig` (with `@model_validator(mode="after")` enforcing `baseline_date < start_date` and `end_date >= start_date`), `load_event(name, events_dir=None)` reading `events/<name>.yaml`.

**Task 3:**
- `data_market.py` — `_data_dir()` honoring `DATA_DIR` env var, `_prices_dir()`, `_csv_path(symbol)` sanitizing `=`/`^`/`/` → `_`, `download_prices(cfg)` (loop over `cfg.tickers`, yfinance with `start=baseline-7d` and `end=end_date+1d`, reset_index, write CSV per ticker), `_load(symbol)`, `get_price_on_date(symbol, d)` returning `Optional[float]`.

- `tests/fixtures/yf_brent_sample.csv` — 8-row OHLCV sample spanning Feb 23 – Mar 4, 2026. Baseline Feb 27 close = 74.20, Mar 4 close = 111.00 (used for Task 4 pct_change assertions).

**Handoff docs (this commit):**
- `CLAUDE.md` — project map, tech stack, plan status, scope lock, conventions.
- `docs/progress.md` — this file.

### Decisions made

**Architecture / tooling:**
- **Claude model access:** chose **Option A** — pay-as-you-go API key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) via console.anthropic.com, using `langchain-anthropic.ChatAnthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-6")`. Rejected Option B (custom wrapper around `claude-agent-sdk` + Max subscription) as too much glue code for a weekend project. **Key not yet obtained — blocker for Plan 2 Task 1.**
- **Python environment:** dedicated conda env `macro-ripple` on Python **3.11** (not user's base 3.13.9) at `/opt/anaconda3/envs/macro-ripple/bin/python`. Reason: `chromadb` + `sentence-transformers` wheels are unreliable on 3.13.
- **Git workflow:** direct commits on `main` (no PRs, no worktrees). One commit per plan-task. Format: `<type>(<scope>): <summary>` with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>` trailer.
- **Execution mode:** hybrid per Plan 1 task — inline for simple/glue (Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12), subagent for independent M1 submodules (Tasks 5 GDELT, 6 NewsAPI, 7 RSS, 9 dedup, 11 embed/index). Plan 2 & 3 modes TBD after Plan 1 finishes.
- **UI stack:** Streamlit local web app (http://localhost:8501). No deployment. streamlit-agraph for ripple tree, Plotly for market charts.
- **Ripple visualization:** chose the tree/graph widget (streamlit-agraph) over plain text tree.

**Code conventions:**
- **Pydantic v2 syntax:** `model_validator(mode="after")` on the instance (not `@root_validator`).
- **Test isolation:** `tmp_data_dir` fixture sets `DATA_DIR` env var so production code writes under `tmp_path`, not the real `data/` dir.
- **External API boundary:** tests mock at the **module attribute** (`monkeypatch.setattr(data_market.yf, "download", fake)`), not at the library itself. This pattern will repeat for GDELT/NewsAPI/RSS.
- **yfinance end date trick:** pass `end=cfg.end_date + timedelta(days=1)` because yfinance treats `end` as exclusive.
- **CSV filename sanitization:** `BZ=F` → `BZ_F.csv`, `^GSPC` → `GSPC.csv`, stripping `=`, `^`, `/`.
- **Live tests:** none yet; when added (M1), gate with `pytest.mark.skipif(not os.getenv("RUN_LIVE"), ...)` so CI and default local runs stay offline.
- **Comments:** none added unless a non-obvious invariant needs documenting. So far, only one such comment in tests (weekend gap explanation).
- **No try/except around internal calls.** Boundary try/except only around external APIs when we add retry/fallback logic (not yet).

**Scope:**
- **MVP = Iran War 2026 only.** No user-input events, no multi-event comparison, no real-time updates, no full-text scraping, no cloud deploy, no KG-RAG, no formal event-study stats, no TruLens.
- **Week 2 addendum:** historical reference corpus of 2–5 markdown files each for the 1979 Iranian Revolution and the 1990–91 Gulf War, to live in `events/historical_reference/`. These are **analytical material feeding M3** (ripple generator prompts/context), not standalone events tracked in the UI.

---

### Current state

**Runs end-to-end:**
- Pytest: `/opt/anaconda3/envs/macro-ripple/bin/pytest -v` → 6 passed.
- `load_event("iran_war")` returns valid `EventConfig`.
- `data_market.download_prices(cfg)` writes one CSV per ticker into `$DATA_DIR/prices/`.
- `data_market.get_price_on_date(symbol, date)` returns close or `None`.

**Stubbed / partial:**
- `data_market.py` has `get_price_on_date` but **not** `get_price_changes` or `get_price_range` yet (Task 4).
- `events/historical_reference/` directory — not yet created; Week 2 work.

**Not started:**
- Plan 1 Tasks 4–12 (M2 finish + M1 news ingest + M1 embed/index + setup.py orchestrator).
- Plan 2 (15 tasks, M3 ripple + M4 LangGraph supervisor).
- Plan 3 (12 tasks, M5 Streamlit UI + §9 eval harness).
- `.env` file with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `NEWSAPI_KEY`.

---

### Blockers / ambiguities

1. **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not yet obtained** — required before Plan 2 Task 1. User chose Option A (pay-as-you-go, ~$5–20 budget). Get from https://console.anthropic.com and add to `.env` as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`.
2. **`NEWSAPI_KEY` not yet obtained** — required before Plan 1 Task 6. Free tier from https://newsapi.org/register.
3. **GDELT has no API key** — zero-setup, but Plan 1 Task 5 should include a live smoke test gated by `RUN_LIVE=1`.
4. **No blockers on Plan 3 yet.**

---

### Next session — exact next step

**Start with Plan 1 Task 4 (inline): "M2 % change vs baseline + price range query".**

Source of truth: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-16-plan-1-data-foundation.md` → Task 4.

Files touched:
- Modify `tests/test_data_market.py` — append `test_get_price_changes_vs_baseline` and `test_get_price_range` (exact code in the plan).
- Modify `data_market.py` — append `get_price_changes(cfg, as_of)` returning `dict[symbol -> {baseline, latest, pct_change}]` and `get_price_range(symbol, start, end)` returning `pd.Series` indexed by date (inclusive both ends, trading days only).

Expected commit: `feat(M2): % change vs baseline + price range query`

After Task 4, continue with Task 5 (GDELT client, subagent) per the plan's mode mapping.
